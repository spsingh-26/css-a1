    <ol>
        <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li> CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media. </li>
        <li> <span style="text-decoration: 1px line-through red; font-weight: bold;">CSS is not necessary</span> 
            <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: 700;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </li>
        <li style="text-decoration: 1px underline; font-style: italic   ;"> External stylesheet are stored in CSS files. </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="italics">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1 </li>
        <li> Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section </li>
        <li> External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file. </li>
        <li> The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 
            how ever, <span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
        <br><br>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.
        <br><br>
        There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
